# metro_analysis


The project focusses on analysing the Delhi Metro's layout and network. Data cleansing, processing, and visualisation are used to understand the distribution and relationships of metro stations across different lines. The analysis makes use of interactive visualisations to map the stations and their corresponding lines.

Libraries Used: 

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, such as dataset loading, missing value management, and data type transformation.

Folium: Create interactive maps that show the geographic locations of metro stations.

Plotly :  allow for extensive and interactive plots and  create complicated, multi-part visualisations.
