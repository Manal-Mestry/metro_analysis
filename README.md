# metro_analysis


The project focusses on analysing the Delhi Metro's layout and network. Data cleansing, processing, and visualisation are used to understand the distribution and relationships of metro stations across different lines. The analysis makes use of interactive visualisations to map the stations and their corresponding lines.
